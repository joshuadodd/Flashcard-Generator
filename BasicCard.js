//This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating basic flashcards.
//The constructor should accept two arguments: `front` and `back`.
//The constructed object should have a `front` property that contains the text on the front of the card.
//The constructed object should have a `back` property that contains the text on the back of the card.

module.exports = BasicCard

// Require the 'inquirer' package
var inquirer = require('inquirer');
